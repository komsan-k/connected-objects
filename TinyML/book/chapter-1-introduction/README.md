# Introduction to TinyML

## Background and Motivation
The last decade has witnessed the rapid expansion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) into nearly every sector of human activity, from healthcare and finance to transportation and education. However, most breakthroughs have relied on large-scale cloud computing infrastructure, data centers, or high-performance platforms (GPUs, TPUs). While effective for centralized data processing, this paradigm poses significant challenges when applied to the billions of small, low-power devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.

**Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML)** has emerged as a transformative approach that enables ML inference directly on microcontrollers and resource-constrained embedded systems. By pushing intelligence to the extreme edge—closer to sensors and actuators—TinyML reduces latency, lowers bandwidth usage, enhances privacy, and provides autonomy to devices that may lack continuous internet access.

The motivation for TinyML is clear: more than 250 billion microcontrollers are already deployed worldwide. If even a fraction of these devices performed low-power inference, the impact would rival past technological revolutions like the personal computer or smartphone.

## What is TinyML?
> **TinyML** is the field of deploying machine learning models on ultra-low-power, memory-constrained microcontrollers and embedded devices, typically consuming milliwatts or less, and operating in real-time on streaming sensor data.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Ultra-low power consumption:** often < 1 mW, enabling always-on sensing  
- **Small memory footprint:** models must fit within tens to hundreds of KB  
- **On-device inference:** no reliance on cloud servers  
- **Latency sensitivity:** decisions within milliseconds  
- **Domain specialization:** audio, vision, time-series, and sensor fusion tasks

## Lab 1.1: Hello TinyML – Blink with Intelligence

### Objective
Differentiate between rule-based and ML-based inference, collect sensor data, implement a threshold-based LED control.

### Hardware/Software Requirements
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense or ESP32 DevKit  
- Sensors: built-in IMU/mic or LDR/button  
- Actuator: onboard LED  
- Arduino IDE + Serial Monitor  

### Background
Traditional embedded systems use threshold rules:
```c
if (sensor_value > threshold) {
   LED_ON;
} else {
   LED_OFF;
}
```

### Step 1: Reading Sensor Data
**Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense:**
```c
#include <Arduino_LSM9DS1.h>
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  if (!IMU.begin()) {
    Serial.println("Failed to initialize IMU!");
    while (1);
  }
}
void loop() {
  float x, y, z;
  if (IMU.accelerationAvailable()) {
    IMU.readAcceleration(x, y, z);
    Serial.print("X: "); Serial.print(x);
    Serial.print(" Y: "); Serial.print(y);
    Serial.print(" Z: "); Serial.println(z);
  }
  delay(100);
}
```

**ESP32 with LDR:**
```c
int sensorPin = 34;
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(100);
}
```

### Step 2: Rule-Based LED Control
```c
int threshold = 500;
void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  if (sensorValue > threshold) {
    digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  }
  delay(100);
}
```

### Discussion Questions
1. What are the limitations of threshold-based decisions?  
2. How does noise affect LED behavior?  
3. Why might TinyML be more robust?  
4. What steps are needed to replace thresholds with models?  

### Learning Outcomes

- Collect, visualize, and act on sensor data  
- Appreciate why ML adds adaptability and robustness
