# Case Studies and Projects with ESP32 and AJAX

## Introduction

In previous chapters, we studied theory and built progressively complex
examples. This chapter consolidates knowledge into full-scale projects.
We analyze case studies across different domains, design complete
dashboards, and benchmark real deployments. These examples bridge the
gap between academic exercises and production-ready IoT systems.

## Case Study 1: Environmental Monitoring Dashboard

### Objective

Monitor light intensity, temperature, and humidity using AJAX and
visualize data in real time with Chart.js.

### System Design

-   Hardware: ESP32 + LDR + DHT11.

-   Software: ESP32 WebServer + Chart.js frontend.

-   Update frequency: 2 seconds.

### ESP32 Code

```  {#code:envmonitor .c++ language="C++" caption="Environmental Monitoring Project" label="code:envmonitor"}
``` cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <WebServer.h>
#include "DHT.h"

#define DHTPIN 4
#define DHTTYPE DHT11
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

WebServer server(80);

void handleSensors(){
  int ldr=analogRead(34);
  float temp=dht.readTemperature();
  float hum=dht.readHumidity();
  String json="{\"ldr\":"+String(ldr)+
              ",\"temp\":"+String(temp,1)+
              ",\"hum\":"+String(hum,1)+"}";
  server.send(200,"application/json",json);
}
```

### Features

-   Multi-sensor integration.

-   JSON endpoint consumed by AJAX.

-   Visualized with Chart.js.

## Case Study 2: Smart Home Dashboard

### Objective

Control actuators (lights, fan, pump) and monitor status using AJAX POST
and GET.

### System Workflow

-   Client sends POST request (toggle command).

-   ESP32 executes action.

-   Client polls `/status` for confirmation.

### Challenges

-   Multi-actuator synchronization.

-   Error handling for lost requests.

## Case Study 3: Healthcare Monitoring Prototype

### Objective

Demonstrate AJAX dashboard for wearable sensors (temperature, heart
rate).

### Design

-   ESP32 collects patient data.

-   Dashboard displays real-time graphs.

-   Alerts triggered if values exceed thresholds.

### Considerations

-   Low latency required.

-   Strong security (password-protected access).

## Case Study 4: Industrial Control Panel

### Objective

Control relays for motors and pumps with real-time feedback.

### Design Features

-   AJAX dashboard with actuator toggles.

-   Error log displayed in table.

-   Safety fallback if connection is lost.

### Failure Recovery

-   Default actuators to OFF if disconnected.

-   Store logs locally until network recovers.

## Benchmarking Project Deployments

### Metrics

-   Latency (ms per request).

-   Bandwidth usage (bytes per second).

-   Maximum concurrent clients before crash.

### Tools

-   Browser DevTools (Network tab).

-   ESP32 serial logs.

-   Apache Benchmark (ab) tool.

## Scalability Challenges

### From One Node to Many

-   One ESP32 â†’ 50 ESP32 nodes.

-   Central aggregator required.

-   Load balancing via cloud/MQTT.

### ESP32 Limitations

-   RAM usage increases with clients.

-   Async server improves scaling.

## Complete Project Example: IoT Agriculture Dashboard

### Objective

Monitor soil moisture and control irrigation pump.

### ESP32 Code Snippet

``` {#code:agri .c++ language="C++" caption="Agriculture AJAX Example" label="code:agri"}
void handleSoil(){
  int soil=analogRead(35);
  server.send(200,"application/json","{\"soil\":"+String(soil)+"}");
}

void handlePump(){
  String body=server.arg("plain");
  if(body=="on") digitalWrite(26,HIGH);
  else digitalWrite(26,LOW);
  server.send(200,"application/json","{\"pump\":\""+body+"\"}");
}
```

### Discussion

-   Dashboard shows soil moisture chart.

-   Pump toggled manually or automatically.

## Case Study 5: Integrated Secure Smart Home

### Objective

Combine authentication, AJAX dashboards, and actuator control.

### Features

-   Password-protected login.

-   Multi-actuator control panel.

-   Chart.js graphs for temperature and energy use.

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

-   Explored case studies in environmental, home, healthcare, and
    industrial IoT.

-   Designed dashboards integrating sensors, actuators, and security.

-   Benchmarked deployments with latency, bandwidth, and scalability
    tests.
