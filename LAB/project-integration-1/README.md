# üåê ESP32 Integrated IoT Project: Smart Environment Monitoring & Control System

This project integrates all lab concepts into a **complete IoT system** built around the ESP32. It demonstrates embedded programming, real-time scheduling, sensor interfacing, reliable communication, and a responsive web dashboard.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The system functions as a **Smart Environment Monitoring & Control Station**.  
It collects data from multiple sensors (LDR, LM73, MPU6050), synchronizes with NTP for accurate timestamps, and provides real-time monitoring through a web-based AJAX dashboard.  

It supports **bidirectional communication**:
- **Upstream:** Sends data to remote PCs/servers via TCP/UDP.
- **Downstream:** Receives control commands from the web dashboard to actuators (LEDs, fans, pumps).

---

## 2. Objectives

- ‚úÖ Initialize and configure ESP32 with NTP for accurate timekeeping.  
- ‚úÖ Develop modular drivers for sensors (LDR, LM73, MPU6050).  
- ‚úÖ Implement interrupt-based event detection (motion, threshold alerts).  
- ‚úÖ Use FreeRTOS scheduling for concurrent task management.  
- ‚úÖ Enable reliable TCP/UDP communication with external servers.  
- ‚úÖ Host an HTTP server with AJAX-enabled dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.  
- ‚úÖ Integrate actuators (LEDs/fans) with feedback and synchronization.  
- ‚úÖ Build a cohesive system suitable for smart home or IoT deployments.
